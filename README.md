**Random Coffee Telegram Bot**

Random Coffee is a Telegram bot designed to foster connections by pairing people for weekly meetups. The pairings are based on common interests and languages, and if the meeting is offline, the participants are paired within the same city.

**How It Works**
1. Sign Up: Participants fill out a Google Form, providing information about their interests, languages spoken, city, and preferred frequency of meetings per month.
2. Pairing: Each week, the bot forms pairs based on the submitted information.
3. Notifications: The bot sends a message to each pair, notifying them of their match.
4. Management: Participants can edit their form responses or change their status from active to inactive using the bot.

**Usage**
We have successfully used the Random Coffee bot over 10 times to help members of the Unit Aware community get to know each other better. Currently, it supports over 50 participants and continues to facilitate meaningful connections.
